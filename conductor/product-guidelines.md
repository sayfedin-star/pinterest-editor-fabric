# Product Guidelines: Pinterest Template Editor`n`n## Core Tone`n* **Professional and Precise:** All user interface elements and system communications must be direct, clear, and focused on efficiency. Avoid unnecessary conversational filler; prioritize information that helps the creator maintain high productivity.`n`n## Visual Identity (Workspace)`n* **Sophisticated Neutrals:** The editor workspace should utilize a refined base of clean whites, soft grays, and deep charcoals. A single, purposeful accent color should be used sparingly to highlight active states, calls to action, or critical focus points, ensuring the interface never competes with the user's design work.`n`n## User Experience & Interaction`n* **Efficient Access:** Navigation and layout should prioritize immediate access. Primary design tools, typography controls, and asset libraries must remain visible or accessible with a single click to facilitate the \"Production Speed\" goal.`n* **Rich Task Feedback:** During batch operations, provide high-density feedback including real-time progress bars, live feeds of completed work, and the ability to continue designing in the background.`n`n## Copywriting & Prose`n* **Action-Oriented:** Interface labels, buttons, and prompts must lead with strong, clear verbs (e.g., \"Generate Pins,\" \"Save Template,\" \"Align Layers\"). Instructions should be concise and focused on the immediate outcome of the user's action.
