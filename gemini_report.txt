The Auto-Fit implementation is logically sound regarding the binary search approach (O(log N)), but it has a significant performance oversight: the comments claim to reuse the `fabric.Textbox` instance for measurements to "avoid memory churn," yet the code creates a new instance on every function call. This causes unnecessary garbage collection and performance degradation during frequent updates (like dragging or typing).

I will optimize `src/lib/canvas/AutoFitText.ts` to strictly reuse a singleton measurement instance and ensure the binary search is robust against edge cases (like empty text).

### Plan
1.  **Refactor `src/lib/canvas/AutoFitText.ts`:**
    *   Implement a module-level `_cachedMeasurementText` singleton.
    *   Initialize it lazily to avoid startup side effects.
    *   Configure it with `objectCaching: false` to speed up property updates (since we only need metrics, not rendering).
    *   Update `calculateBestFitFontSize` to use this cached instance.
    *   Preserve the binary search logic but ensure it handles the iteration limits safely.

2.  **Verify `ObjectFactory.ts`:**
    *   The `applyAutoFit` usage in `ObjectFactory.ts` is correct (calling it after object creation and during sync), so no changes are needed there. The optimization in `AutoFitText.ts` will automatically benefit the factory.

I will now apply the optimizations to `src/lib/canvas/AutoFitText.ts`.
